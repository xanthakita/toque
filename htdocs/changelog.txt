        -- Altered index2.php with some preliminary form code. Need to get JW to remind me how we had said we were going to
            store/associate each recipe's ingredients (as in how they relate to each recipe, not just the table of available
            ingredients).

Elliot Derhay

        -- Will continue messing with the PHP for a bit on and off tonight; not checking out index2.php since I don't see a 
                reason anyone else would be working in it today.

        20:45

2-26-2013
        20:43
        -- renamed new_recipe_form.php to new_recipe.php to prevent confusion. From now on, forms for display will be amended with 
            _form, while their PHP back-ends will have the same name without _form. (i.e., new_recipe.php is the back-end
            processing for new_recipe_form.php, which will be the form with which the user interacts.).

        22:15
        -- made some minor changes to new_recipe_form.php, including using the HTML5 textarea placeholder attribute to incorporate hints for users.

2-27-2013
        18:40
        -- ## DATABASE CHANGES ## --
        -- Added measurements "Pinch" and "To Taste" to measurements table.
        -- ALTERed style table to mimic exactly the taste table. Both now have 2 fields: an id and a varchar description.

        -- Punched myself for changing database as a result of not understanding things we had discussed. Changed it back.
        "Taste" will now describe all keywords which tell about a recipe. 

        22:32
        -- Changed connection method of database.php to PDO (older mysql_ functions are deprecated in PHP5)
        -- Got Tastes select boxes working on new_recipe_form.php
        -- ## DATABASE CHANGES ## --
        -- Renamed "Tastes" table to "tastes" for casing consistency
        -- Added a NULL record to tastes table to allow for blank tastes in recipe input
        -- Added "Heart-healthy" to list of tastes

3-1-13
        11:51
        -- Began work today on new_user_form.php. Formatting is broken while I work on fields display. May want a separate CSS element
            for this form, or may simply want to change the sideinclude. 
        -- Made some minor changes to new_recipe_form.php. Considering wrapping the labels and input fields in a table for more
            uniform display. ELLIOT, your thoughts on this?
			Elliot:	That's how I learned to build forms.  CSS forms can be done though, and table elements aren't affected by a lot of CSS positioning and sizing attributes for some odd reason...  Other thoughts?

3-1-13 1:32pm
	Uploaded JS folder, calc.js and calcTest.html.  Starting calculator programming after 3:20pm.
3-1-13 6:39pm
	Uploaded jquery-1.9.1.min.js (minimized jQuery library)
	Checking in calc.js, calcTest.css and calcTest.html
	-- copied calculator from sideInclude.php to calcTest.html for calculator testing
	-- replaced calculator placeholder values with functional text fields
	-- created styles for test pages, including new "Recalculate" and "Reset" chocolate buttons styles
	-- created jQuery-based cost calculator.
		FUNCTIONS:
		1) reading in cost data from hidden field
		2) calculating ingredient costs (needed amount - on-hand amount * cost per grocery unit)
		3) calculating and displaying final cost based on how many batches will be made
		4) resetting values back to default (0 on hand, 1 batch, recalculating based on these values)
		NOTE:  Need to figure out how to tell user the calculator is based on groceries, not measuring units
		COMMENT:  go to [site]/js/calcTest.html to test the calculator
3-1-13 7:13pm
	Uploaded favicon.ico
3-1-13 10:30pm
	Uploaded calc.css (modifed calcTest.css)
	Checking in calc.css, calc.js, sideInclude.php and recipe.php
	-- attached calc.css to recipe.php for button styles, though with slight changes
	-- replaced calculator placeholder in sideInclude.php with functional calculator from calcTest.html
		NOTE:  This calculator has a hidden span element in it with ID "vals" in it.  Prices are in 2 decimal format (no dollar sign), each ending with a semicolon.  This data is all that's needed in the SPAN element for the calculator to function correctly, so long as the number of unit prices matches the number of ingredients displayed in the calculator (in this case, the number of semicolons, since there's 1 at the end of each price).
3-1-13 10:32
	Checking in sideInclude.php
	-- modified the calculator's item displaying prices to match the hidden span element.  Placeholder prices should make more sense now.

        -- Changed ssi/footer.htm to ssi.footer.php to allow for php scripting.

        -- Created login controller. User can login and a session is established.
            This involved tacking a super crude submit button on to the nice float.html. It works. Can be pretty later.
        -- Started logout controller. Needs tweaking.

	-- made "x" button switch back to login form while hiding div
	-- made form and a link values site-relative
		NOTE for Dave:  I'm hoping this doesn't break the forms.  I know site-relative linking works for most HTML-based resources, but I'm not sure about forms.
3-26-13 2:36
	Checking in base.css, new_recipe.js and new_recipe_form.php
	-- added "Add row" and "Delete" buttons to the table, with some minor style changes
