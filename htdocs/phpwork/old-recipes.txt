					Minted lamb pitas with red onion and tomato salad
					by Benjamin Jackson
					in Lamb Recipes
				
				

This recipe has Greek flavors in abundance. Marinating any meat in yogurt makes it very tender, the longer it is left marinating before cooking, the better.

Ingredients
325 lamb escalope’s or steaks, fat trimmed off
200g chopped plum tomatoes
1 small red onion, thinly sliced into rings
2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
2 wholemeal pita breads
lemon wedges, to serve
For the marinade
 3 tablespoons Greek yogurt
1 garlic clove, crushed
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint
mint leaves for the salad
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
sea salt and ground black pepper
a squeeze of lemon juice, a little extra for the lamb
Cooking instructions
First you need to make the marinade. Mix together the yogurt, garlic, chopped mint, lemon juice and cumin in a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Put the lamb steaks on a plate and smother each of them with the marinade. Cover and leave in a cool place to marinate for a few minutes.
While the lamb is busy marinating, mix together the tomatoes, red onion, mint sprigs, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and add salt and pepper to taste.
Take the lamb out of the marinade. Take a heavy based grill pan or griddle and brush it with the remaining oil, place on the heat until it starts to smoke. Cook the lamb for about 3 minutes on each side.
Take the pita breads and briefly place them under running water, the put them in the toaster or under a hot grill for a few minutes. This will make sure that they puff up but not become brown and crisp. Sprinkle the cooked lamb with a squeeze of lemon juice and slice thickly. Split the pita breads open and fill with the tomato salad and slices of lamb.
As a variety, the marinade also works well with chicken fillets that have been slightly beaten flat before marinating.

					Japanese Sushi Rolls
					by Philip Lam
					in Sushi
				
				

Japanese food is almost always low in fat, and these beautifully presented sushi rolls are no exception. Each sushi roll contains only 0.4g fat, and 1mg cholesterol. These days you can easily pick up the ingredients in a local supermarket and it is very easy to make them at home. Please remember, you must use sushi rice, which will be sticky once cooked!

Ingredients
40g deseeded cucumber - chopped very finely
sushi nori - 4 sheets
120g smoked salmon
300g sushi rice
2 tablespoons caster sugar
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 spring onions, very finely chopped
2 teaspoons Wasabi paste
pickled ginger to garnish
Soy sauce to serve
Cooking Instructions
Cook the sushi rice in boiling water - refer to pack for cooking times.
While the rice is cooking, put the sugar and rice wine vinegar in a pan and heat until the sugar dissolves. Once the rice is cooked, drizzle the sugar/vinegar mixture over it and add the spring onions and chopped cucumber. Cover with a cloth and leave to cool.
Divide the rice into four portions. Slice the salmon into 1cm wide strips.  Place a sheet of nori (shiny side down) on a bamboo mat. You can use a sheet of baking parchment but bamboo will be easier if you have it. Spread one of the four rice portions over the nori. Press it down evenly, leaving a 1cm gap around each side.
Now place one quarter of the salmon along the center of the layer of rice.  Spread 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi paste on the salmon.  Using the bamboo mat, roll up the nori tightly. You should roll it as tightly as you can to ensure the sticky rice holds everything together. Repeat the above steps to create 3 more rolls.
Use a wet knife to cut each roll into eight equal sized slices, standing them upright on a serving plate. Rinse the knife between each cut. Garnish with pieces of pickled ginger and a small dish of soy sauce.

Ponzu sauce can be made a day or more in advance. Place the mirin in a small pan, bring to the boil over a high heat and continue to boil for 30 seconds - this evaporates the alcohol. Stir in all the remaining sauce ingredients and remove the pan from the heat. Pour into a covered dish and set aside.
Soak the noodles in cold water for 10 minutes before draining and setting aside. Bring the chicken stock to the boil in a large casserole dish. Reduce the heat, add the chicken pieces and allow to simmer for 10 minutes.
Add the carrots and bring back to simmering, then cook for 5 minutes. Add the bamboo and mange-tout and simmer for a further 3 minutes.  Now add the mushrooms and chinese leaves, again simmering for 3 minutes. Finally, add the rice noodles, bring back to simmering and cook till the noodles are hot - this should take another 3-4 minutes.
Divide the sauce into four small bowls, to be served along with the casserole in warm serving bowls.
As a seafood alternative, you can replace the chicken stock for fish stock, and swap the chicken for 450g of firm white fish (cod would be perfect). Add 12 raw peeled prawns with the mushrooms. Please note, if you use fish rather than chicken the first cooking time should be reduced from 10 minutes to 5.

					Chocolate Fudge Brownies
					by Jessica Taylor
					in Puddings & Desserts
				
				
The perfect brownie is moist in the center with a deep chocolate flavor. This recipe uses both chocolate and cocoa powder to give plenty of flavor, and muscovado sugar for the wonderful fudgy texture.

Ingredients
90g high quality chocolate (at least 70% cocoa)
100g margarine
125g caster sugar
100g light muscovado sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 whole eggs and 1 egg yolk
3 tablespoons cocoa powder
100g plain white flour
Cooking Instructions
Switch the oven on to 360 ° F  (180°C). Grease a shallow square cake tin. Line it with baking parchment.
While the oven is heating, allow the eggs to go to room temperature then beat them together. Break up the chocolate and place in a large bowl with the margarine. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Do not allow the water to touch the bowl or the chocolate will burn. Once the mixture has melted, stir until completely smooth. Set aside until cooled.
Add the caster suger, vanilla extract and muscovado sugar to the chocolate and margarine mix. Stir in until blended. Gradually beat in the eggs. Sift over the cocoa powder and flour, then stir till evenly blended.
Pour the mix into the tin. Bake for about 30 minutes - it should be risen but slightly soft in the center. You can test this by inserting a skewer into the middle. It should come out with a few moist crumbs on it. Do not overcook or the brownies will dry out.
Leave in the tin for 5 minutes to cool, before turning out onto a rack to cool completely. Once cold, peel off the lining paper and cut into 16 even squares. Brownies are best wrapped tightly in foil and eaten the day after cooking, though they will keep for 4 days.

3 oz of caster sugar
1.5 oz of granulated sugar
1/2 tablespoon of cornflour
1/2 tablespoon of vinegar
3 egg whites
Cooking Instructions
Preheat the oven to 225 °F (110 °C)

Don’t overdo it because you want to maintain as much volume as possible.
Using the base of a 8 inch cake tin, draw a circle on a square of non stick paper and pour the mixture on it, spreading it evenly.
Alternatively you could drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the non stick paper to make meringues.
Bake for 2 hours without interruption. When baking is finished allow it to cool for some time.
Decorate with whipped cream and fresh fruit like strawberries and mixed berries, and the pavlova cake is ready to serve.

					Lemon Sorbet
					by Jessica Taylor

Lemon sorbet would have to be one of the most popular desserts for summer. The bitterness and sweetness are very contrasting flavors which work so well together. It’s very refreshing on a hot day. Sorbets come in other flavors but I find the lemon to work the best.Ingredients
2 teaspoons of lemon rind, finely grated
9 tablespoons of lemon juice
2/3 cup of sugar, granulated
2 1/4 cups of water
1 egg white
Cooking Instructions
Add the sugar, water and lemon rind into a large saucepan over a medium heat, stirring occasionally. Continue to cook until the sugar starts to dissolve into the liquid. Bring it to a boil and allow to cook for 10 minutes, or until it forms a syrup like consistency.
Remove the syrup from the heat and allow to cool down completely.
Add the lemon juice from 3 lemons, mix well and pour into a storage container. Cover and store in the freezer until the lemon juice has thickened and and is slushy.
Add the egg white into the mixture, and fold until it thickens up. Put the sorbet back into the freezer and freeze until stiff.

Ingredients
4 Mars bars

Lie the kebab meat out in strips on a plate.

Now carefully wrap each mars bar in a strip of kebab meat - use toothpicks to secure if required.

Put a pan of cooking oil on to heat. You will know its ready as a cube of bread will quickly crisp up if dropped in. Take your batter and completely coat the mars bars.

Now drop them carefully into the hot oil

After a couple of minutes they should be ready - they will rise to the top and the batter will be golden. Remove them and place on paper towels to soak up the excess oil. Serve immediately. They can be served on their own, or on a bread roll on a bed of kebab meat.

					North African Cuisine
					by Philip Lam

If you are a fan of North African dishes, then an essential item you must have in your kitchen is a Tagine. This is a type of cookware, often used in the oven, to create amazingly flavorful dishes, often found in North African influenced cuisine.
Tagine cooking is a great way to preserve the flavor of your ingredients, and create amazingly rich dishes that you will absolutely love. This type of cookware has traditionally been used over a fire, the unique top catches the moisture and lets it drip back down into the food, enhancing it’s natural flavors. Normally, the bottom “pan” is made of cast iron, which is a material long known to intensify the flavor of food, and only become more effective with frequent use, capturing the seasoning of the food. The conical lid is often stoneware, and is shaped to not let any flavor escape through rising and collecting moisture that usually evaporates and leaves your food dry and tasteless.
Using a Tagine is a great way to great cultural cuisine in your own traditional oven, using a simple technique in it’s unique shape to keep your food tasting the way it should. Tagine cookware also makes a great gift for your cooking savvy friends!

					Bake Like An Expert
					by Jessica Taylor
					in Utensils
				
				
In everyone’s life, there has been an occasion, and often more than one, that we wished we could bake for someone we loved. Whether it is for your husband on Valentine’s Day, or for your grandmother on her birthday, baking is a great skill to have for thoughtful, and personal gifts. Any professional baker will tell you that your skills will start with the tools you have.
Being equipped with the proper tools to create your masterpiece will make the difference in the result. Knowing which of your cake tins, for example, you should use is also an important part of being a successful baker. There is a vast world of bakeware, and each utensil is aimed at a specific dessert or project.
The best advice is to learn as you go. If you want to make cookies, research every tip and trick you can about cookies, and perfect it. Baking is all about trial and error. Once you perfect a recipe, you can keep those skills and that knowledge with you into all your baking projects. For example, oven temperatures, rack height, and other details are very much transferable, as nearly all baking requires an oven. And often this is to blame for your mishaps, rather than the ingredients used.

					Quick Dinner Ideas

					in Quick Dinners
				
				
Coming up with something new every night that everyone in your family will like is difficult. We try to cater to everyone’s specific tastes, and at the same time keep the meals fresh and new so we don’t get bored. This becomes increasingly more difficult when time is an issue. Most of us don’t have hours to prepare elaborate dishes, so quick dinner recipes are an asset to any kitchen.
Some tips to keep the flavor alive, but the meal prep time down, are as follows. First you should try to use fresh herbs as much as possible. You can often buy them in your grocery store, pre potted and pre grown, so just keep them in a sunny window sill, and convert any recipe that calls for dried herbs to use fresh ones. This takes little effort, and can really bring out the natural flavors in any meal, no matter how fast you need to prepare it. Herbs can make the difference between a simple, boring meal, and a flavorful, memorable meal with the same amount of time spent preparing.
You can also cut down on prep time by investing in decent utensils, such as kitchen knives. This is safer, and faster.

Deep frying chicken is also a popular option. You can dip chicken strips or whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts in egg, then sprinkle with breadcrumbs before deep frying, for home made chicken nuggets or crispy chicken patties.

Anyone can easily become weary of cooking day after day, even when just for ourselves, and especially for a big family. It is hard to come up with creative ideas that taste good, and don’t take hours to prepare. There is also the matter of budget, and health to consider when coming with meal ideas. But there are plenty of healthy recipes out there to help you keep yourself healthy, and provide nutritional options for your family without breaking the bank.
There are a few key, simple and quick meals that you can use as a base, and spice up a few details to keep them unique. A salad for instance may seem like a boring idea, and more of a side rather than a meal, but this is far from true. For example, make a salad with mixed leafy greens, grill some chicken breasts for a low fat protein solution, cut them in slices and mix together with a low fat dressing. This is a great filler with lots of protein and essential nutrients from the veggies that you include. You can mix up the lettuce, greens, and veggies you use to keep it interesting. Healthy food doesn’t have to be boring or expensive!

					Thanksgiving Day Favorites
					by admin
					in Puddings & Desserts
				
				
For those who celebrate Thanksgiving with a large meal, you’ll probably have several traditional favorites. Cooking and baking for Thanksgiving is exciting, and often a day long event. There is the Turkey or main course, sides, desserts and more. From mashed potatoes and gravy to pecan pie, everyone has a favorite on Thanksgiving day.
If you plan on hosting Thanksgiving day dinner this year, you’ll want some useful tips to help guide you. The turkey will be in the oven through out the day, which will give you time to cook the sides and other courses. If possible, the best tip is to bake all desserts the night before, as the oven will be occupied as mentioned before. Desserts such as puddings, that are served cold, can remain in the fridge until served. Cakes and pies can be chilled overnight and then left at room temperature or reheated in the oven before serving. Preparing as much the day or night before is essential, but maintaining freshness is also important. Remember to allow yourself time to cook or heat all of the vegetables and side dishes. Another great tip is to ask guests to bring along a dish, which can cut down on time spent in the kitchen, especially if there is only one oven.
