Ideas for future updates:

1. add somewhere a welcome to the most recently signed up user.
2. Add a count of currently logged in users
3.set it up so admins are notified via email when a new recipe is inserted and when a picture needs approved (allow to be turned off at some point)
4. add firstname to register form
5. change header on add ingredient form to not show extra (old) info
